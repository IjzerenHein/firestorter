### Fixed

- Fixed schema violation in `Document.update/set` when using a dotted FieldPath.
- Fixed schema violation in `Document.update/set` when deleting fields using FieldValue.delete().

## [0.14.0] - 2018-06-17

### Added

- Added `Collection.minimizeUpdates` option to prevent multiple updates when starting real-time updates on a Collection. This happens when some of the query results are loally cached, causing Firestore to fire multiple `onSnapshot` events. Enabling this option causes Firestorter to skip/debounce the first local snapshot, in favor of the full result received slightly later from the cloud.

### Fixed

- Fixed unneccessary re-start of real-time updates on `Collection` when the query changes.

## [0.12.1] - 2018-06-11

### Changed

- Replaced `fetching` with the `isLoading` property (better name + isLoading also causes realtime updates to become active, fixes #18)
- Renamed `active` prop to `isActive` (active still supported but shows deprecation warning)

### Fixed

- Fixed `Collection.add` still writing to firestore when schema didn't validate

### Removed

- Removed obsolete firestore snapshot fields `Document.createTime`, `Document.updateTime` and `Document.readTime`

### Fixed

- Fixed `Document.update` throwing exception when schema was used.

## [0.11.0] - 2018-05-30

### Added

- Added new method for defining queries using an observed function (e.g. `col.query = (ref) => ref.orderBy('text', 'asc')`). This is now the new recommended way for defining queries.
