# Firestorter

Use Firestore in React with zero effort, using MobX ðŸ¤˜

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.4] - 2018-11-16

### Added

- Added TypeScript as a first-class language (converted to TypeScript and added type-bindings)
- Added Collection `createDocument` factory function, in which documents can be created based on the snapshot data (`new Collection({createDocument: (source, options) => return new Document(source, options)}))`)

### Fixed

- Fixed exception when accessing `Document.source` or `Collection.source`

### Removed

- Removed deprecated `active` property from Collection & Document (use `isActive` instead)
- Removed deprecated `fetching` property from Collection & Document (use `isLoading` instead)

### Deprecated

- The Collection `DocumentClass` constructor option has been deprecated (use `createDocument` instead)

## [0.16.1] - 2018-09-28

### Fixed

- Fixed schema validation in `Document.update` or `Document.set` sometimes failed, when data document data contained arrays or sub-objects

## [0.16.0] - 2018-09-24

### Added

- Added ability to disable the Collection by returning `null` from a query function (this may break some things)
- Added automatic removal of all documents from a Collection when it is disabled (when `path` or `ref` is cleared or query is set to `null`)

### Changed

- Made snapshot errors more verbose so simplify debugging

## [0.15.4] - 2018-09-14

### Fixed

- Fixed exception when calling `.update()` on a document with a schema, that has not yet been fetched

## [0.15.3] - 2018-09-13

### Fixed

- Fixed `lodash.isequal` not defined as a direct dependency

## [0.15.2] - 2018-09-12

### Added

- Added logging of `onSnapshot` errors

### Fixed

- Fixed exception when fetching a Document which doesnâ€™t exist and which has a schema defined

## [0.15.1] - 2018-09-05

### Added

- Added log-message when Document snapshot failed

### Fixed

- Fixed schema validation error not using the `debugName` when specified to constructor

## [0.15.0] - 2018-08-31

### Added

- Added support for code-debugging and smaller bundles on react-native (`react-native` entry in package.json)
- Added support for specifying a specific firebase-app to use, instead of always using the default firebase app (`initFirestorter({firebase, app})`)

## [0.14.2] - 2018-07-12

### Fixed

- Fixed Document not triggering a reaction after calling `Document.update` with a field-path

### Added

- Added debug statement to log `Document` snapshot updates

## [0.14.1] - 2018-07-11

### Fixed

- Fixed schema violation in `Document.update/set` when using a dotted FieldPath.
- Fixed schema violation in `Document.update/set` when deleting fields using FieldValue.delete().

## [0.14.0] - 2018-06-17

### Added

- Added `Collection.minimizeUpdates` option to prevent multiple updates when starting real-time updates on a Collection. This happens when some of the query results are loally cached, causing Firestore to fire multiple `onSnapshot` events. Enabling this option causes Firestorter to skip/debounce the first local snapshot, in favor of the full result received slightly later from the cloud.

### Fixed

- Fixed unneccessary re-start of real-time updates on `Collection` when the query changes.

## [0.12.1] - 2018-06-11

### Changed

- Replaced `fetching` with the `isLoading` property (better name + isLoading also causes realtime updates to become active, fixes #18)
- Renamed `active` prop to `isActive` (active still supported but shows deprecation warning)

### Fixed

- Fixed `Collection.add` still writing to firestore when schema didn't validate

### Removed

- Removed obsolete firestore snapshot fields `Document.createTime`, `Document.updateTime` and `Document.readTime`

## [0.11.1] - 2018-06-04

### Fixed

- Fixed `Document.update` throwing exception when schema was used.

## [0.11.0] - 2018-05-30

### Added

- Added new method for defining queries using an observed function (e.g. `col.query = (ref) => ref.orderBy('text', 'asc')`). This is now the new recommended way for defining queries.

## [0.10.0] - 2018-03-27

### Added

- Added support for MobX 4 (for MobX 3.x, use 0.9.3 or lower)
